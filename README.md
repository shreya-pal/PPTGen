# PPTGen ‚Äì Auto-Generate a Presentation from Text

**Your Text, Your Style ‚Äì Turn bulk text or markdown into a polished PowerPoint presentation.**

PPTGen is a lightweight web app that lets you paste long-form text (markdown, prose, notes, reports) and instantly convert it into a styled, ready-to-present PowerPoint deck. Simply upload your own template, add optional guidance, and supply your preferred LLM API key; the app will handle the rest.
